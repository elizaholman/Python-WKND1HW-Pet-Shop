# Python Weekend 1 HW - Pet Shop
Weekend homework with the brief: 
"For your weekend homework your task is to write some functions to be used in a pet shop.
We have provided some tests for you. Your job is simply to make those tests pass! Work on one at a time, and when you're ready to move on, unskip the next test, watch it fail, then make it pass. Do not modify the code in the tests."
